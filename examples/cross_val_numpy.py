"""
This file contains an example implementation of cross-validation using IKPLS.
It demonstrates how to perform weighted cross-validation with column-wise centering and
scaling. It also demonstrates metric computation and evaluation.

The code includes the following functions:
- `wmse_for_each_target`: A function to compute the weigthed mean squared error for each
    target and the number of components that achieves the lowest MSE for each target.

To run the cross-validation, execute the file.

Note: The code assumes the availability of the `ikpls` package and its dependencies.
